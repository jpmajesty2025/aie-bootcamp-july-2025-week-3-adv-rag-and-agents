# Planning Discussion 1: Dependency Scanner Design

## 1. Using knowledge_graph_qa.py as Guide

You're absolutely right. Looking at `knowledge_graph_qa.py`, I can see it uses:
- LangChain for LLM integration
- Neo4j for graph storage
- Structured schema with `allowed_nodes` and `allowed_relationships`
- Pydantic models for data validation

For `uv` package management, we'll need to create a `pyproject.toml` file. Let me check what's already there:

Perfect! We have a basic `pyproject.toml`. We'll need to add our dependencies.

## 2. Schema Design

Your intuition is correct, but let me propose a more detailed schema that will serve both the scanner and vulnerability system well:

### Proposed Schema:

**Nodes:**
- `File` - Source files in repositories
- `Module` - Imported modules (both internal and external)
- `Package` - External packages from dependency files
- `Repository` - GitHub repositories
- `Function` - Specific functions/classes imported (for granular analysis)
- `Vulnerability` - Security vulnerabilities (for vulnerability_system.py)

**Relationships:**
- `IMPORTS` - File imports a module (direct imports)
- `IMPORTS_FROM` - File imports specific items from module (from ... import)
- `RELATIVE_IMPORTS` - Relative imports within same repository
- `DEPENDS_ON` - File depends on external package
- `BELONGS_TO` - File belongs to repository
- `CONTAINS` - Module contains specific functions/classes
- `HAS_VULNERABILITY` - Package/Module has vulnerability (for vulnerability_system.py)

This schema allows `vulnerability_system.py` to:
- Trace dependency chains efficiently
- Identify which specific functions are vulnerable
- Understand import granularity for impact assessment

## 3. Repository Suggestions

Great idea to clone ahead! Here are my suggestions:

**Python-focused repos:**
- `langchain-ai/langchain` - Complex Python project with many dependencies
- `openai/openai-python` - Good mix of internal/external dependencies

**Multi-language repos:**
- `microsoft/vscode` - Large TypeScript/JavaScript project
- `facebook/react` - JavaScript with complex dependency structure

**Smaller test repos:**
- `requests/requests` - Python HTTP library (manageable size)
- `pallets/flask` - Python web framework

I'd recommend starting with `langchain-ai/langchain` since it's Python-focused and we're already familiar with it from `knowledge_graph_qa.py`.

## 4. Environment Variables

Perfect! We'll use the `.env` file for configuration.

## 5. Granular Import Handling

Excellent question! For `from pathlib import Path`, I propose this approach:

**Two-level relationship:**
1. `myfile.py -[IMPORTS_FROM]-> pathlib` (module-level relationship)
2. `myfile.py -[IMPORTS_SPECIFIC]-> Path` (specific item relationship)
3. `pathlib -[CONTAINS]-> Path` (module contains item)

This allows `vulnerability_system.py` to:
- Query "which files import pathlib?" (broad impact)
- Query "which files import Path specifically?" (granular impact)
- Trace vulnerability impact at both module and function levels

## 6. Neo4j Connection

Absolutely! The `neo4j+ssc://` protocol is for Neo4j AuraDB (cloud). We'll use that connection format and make it configurable.

## 7. Advanced Features

**Efficient Querying:**
- Use Neo4j's Cypher query optimization
- Create proper indexes on frequently queried properties
- Use parameterized queries for performance
- Leverage Neo4j's graph algorithms for dependency traversal

**Repository Change Monitoring:**
- Store commit hashes and timestamps
- Implement incremental scanning (only scan changed files)
- Use git hooks or polling to detect changes
- Maintain version history of dependency graphs

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update pyproject.toml** with required dependencies
2. **Design the schema** with the proposed nodes/relationships
3. **Implement core scanner** using LangChain patterns from `knowledge_graph_qa.py`
4. **Add granular import parsing** for specific function/class imports
5. **Implement efficient Neo4j queries** for dependency traversal
6. **Add change monitoring** capabilities
